## My favorites

* Odd Duck - ($40) - Seasonal farm to table small plates.

* Hopdoddy - $10 burger. Worth going if there's not a line. The weekly special is usually good. At first, I shunned the turkey burger "The Continental", but it's surprisingly good.

* Salty Sow - ($40) - on E Manor. Good happy hour and good food. I'm a fan of the pate jar.

* Ramen Tatsuya - ($15) - I think this is the best ramen in Austin, but...
Michi Ramen - ($15) - Doesn't have a wait like Tatsuya and has more unique ramen (Texas twist)

* Second Bar+Kitchen - ($50) - I think they have one of the best burgers in Austin. Their other entrees are good and they have good small plates too. I hear good things about their cocktails too.

* Round Rock Donuts - $6 - I really like these donuts.

## Foodie places - Well-known and respected in Austin, but I think most of these are overrated

* Uchi - ($100) - The original nice restaurant and perennial "best" restaurant in Austin. Just south of the river on Lamar. Uchi and Uchiko will always have fresh fish, but are overpriced if you've ever had good sushi anywhere else.

* Uchiko - ($75) - The more casual offshoot of Uchi on N. Lamar. For some reason, the sushi rice is always too dry for my taste.

* East Side King - ($15) - multiple locations around town, each with their own specials. Asian fusion. The quality has dropped off. The qui buns used to be one of my favorite pork belly buns, but now they're just ok.

* Qui - ($50) - The high-end East Side King. I went when they were still new. Maybe they've fixed their menu since then. The fish collar was fantastic.

* Sway - ($25) - Fusion Thai food. I've had some very good dishes there, but the last time I was there was a big miss. Some poorly executed specials and everything was too salty.

* Lenoir - ($45) - Prix-fixe seasonal menu

* Parkside - ($30) - Nice spot amongst Dirty Sixth

* Foreign and Domestic - ($40) - Fun gourmet food

* Salt & Time - ($30) - butcher shop that's also a small restaurant. Good artisanal meats, Texas style. I do not recommend the oft-lauded beef fat donut.

* Cafe Josie - ($30) - Get the redfish and molten chocolate cake.

* Mandola's Market - ($18) - Try whatever the special is.

## Austin Staples

* Homeslice - NY style pizza
* East Side Pies - Good pizza with quality toppings
* Litte Deli - mmmmmm

* Whataburger - local burger chain. Get fat.
* P. Terry's - local local burger chain. Get a double cheeseburger and a veggie burger with bacon. 

* Lamberts - ($50) - Most of the food here is over-priced and under-delivers. But if you stick to the higher-end items, the quality rises to meet the price. I'd go for lunch and avoid it for dinner. Oh, and get the mac & cheese and the ribeye.

* Austin Land & Cattle - Probably the best steak in Austin. Doesn't compare to high-end steakhouses in other cities though. Lambert's ribeye is better, but it's also a little different.

* Kerbey Lane - Good place to eat at 3 AM.

* Wink - ($70) - try the sweetbreads

* FINO - ($50) - The only thing I can remember are stuffed dates and toast

* Eddie V's - ($70) - A nice place to eat. They used to have a fantastic Chilean sea bass but now that they're extinct it's gone. Maybe. I think it's still on the menu, but it's not the same. Good for Happy Hour.

## Hang out places - take advantage of the nice weather now for these places. Most have patios.

* Black Star Coop - Gastropub

* Justine's - Good spot on on the east side. I don't know of any other place in Austin to get escargot.

* Contigo - ($20) - patio spot

* Gourdough's Public House - ($20) - Think of a meal. Now throw a donut in there. That's this place.

* Curras - ($12) - Very filling "Tex-mex" that's more Mexican than Texan. They're a sponsor of the Tribune too.

* Torchy's - ($10) - Tacos loaded with calories
* Veracruz All Natural - ($10) - Tacos made from excellent ingredients

## Other

* Gus's Fried Chicken - national chain that just opened downtown, too salty, but still good.
* Lucy's Fried Chicken

* BBQ: Franklin John Mueller Meat Company La Barbeque, Stiles Switch, Valentina's, Rudy's
